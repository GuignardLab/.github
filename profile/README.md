# Computer Science, Morphogenesis and Variability ‼️[Open positions](https://www.guignardlab.com/jobs)‼️

 👋 Hello and welcome to the GitHub of the Guignard Lab or the Computer Science, Morphogenesis and Variability group 👋

We are theoreticians from many different backgrounds (🧑‍🔬biology, 🧑‍💻computer science, physics or mathematics). We work at trying to 🕵️better our understanding of embryo formation. We develop novel methods to quantify the development at the single cell scale using recordings from 🔬fluorescence microscopy🔬 and 🧬spatial omics🧬 and many different model and non-model organisms: 🐭mouse, 🦐Parhyale or gastruloids for example.

We mainly code in 🐍 Python 🐍 but are open to any open source language.

You can find more information about our research on our [webpage](https://www.guignardlab.com) or on the [group page of the IBDM website](https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/team/computer-science-morphogenesis-and-variability/)
